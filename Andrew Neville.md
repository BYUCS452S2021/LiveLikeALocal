Hello! I think this is a cool idea, and I'd like to join this project.

Since you mentioned it possibly being an app, I have some experience with front end development on Android (CS 240!) as well as iOS, and I'd be happy to contribute to that aspect of the project and/or integrating it with the backend.

For Business, I think ads as a revenue source makes sense. I agree with the items in the Operations and Legal sections. I also agree with the order of priorities specified in the Technical section, maybe some kind of a beta rollout could help with the data collection. For Social, we might also consider incentives for signing up or participating in the early stages of the product, to build our user base.

If you're interested in working together, you can email me at andrewneville404@gmail.com or message me on Slack (Andrew Neville).
