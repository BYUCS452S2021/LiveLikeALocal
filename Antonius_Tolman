Hello,

My name is Antonius Tolman. I like the idea. I think it is a simple and effective way to help people enjoy trips and visiting new areas more. As for what I can contribute. I have had a decent ammount of
experience with android front end due to CS 240/340 and during my time as a CS 240 TA. I have also had some experience with java backend and this is what I would like to focus on.

Thought on the pitch:
Implementation: This seems like a good place to start from and easy to grow and expand off of the base idea.

Business: Good plan to start.

Operations: I like the current plan and future options.

Legal: looks fine to me.

Technical: I like the planing.

Social: I like it.

To contact me you can use my email, anttolman1@gmail.com or slack, my name on slack is Antonius Tolman
