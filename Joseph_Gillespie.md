  Hi!  My name is Joseph Gillespie and I'd like to join your team for this project!  Your idea sounds like a fun one to implement and which would give us good practice working with lots of information in different database tables.

  As far as what I could contribute, I (like Andrew) have experience with Android frontend and doing a Java backend from CS 240.  I also have some experience working with nodejs for backend.  I´ve also taken IS 201 before and have had some practice working with SQL and a mySQL database.  I´m also ready to learn and take on new things when needed for the project to succeed!

Thoughts:

Business - I like your ideas of having local businesses pay for ads or for being highlighted.  Another potential idea would be to have users pay a certain amount to eliminate ads.

Operations and Legal - Both look good!

Technical - I think the priorities in this section are a good starting point. For the data collection part, we could start with some test data that we input ourselves just to make sure the app is working correctly, then start getting data from others.

Social - I think the ideas for word of mouth and advertising are good for letting people know about the app, though getting it started with little information would be hard.  Like Andrew said, it could be useful to have some kind of incentive for people to contribute information about where they live to start making the app useful.  Maybe it could work like glassdoor, where in order to use our service, they have to first add a place in their local area or leave a review.

Let me know if you´d like to have me on your team! My name on Slack is Joseph Gillespie and my email is josephagillesp@gmail.com
