# LiveLikeALocal
 Ever visit a place or move to a place where you want to do fun things? Yelp and TripAdvisor give you some cool ideas but those always seem to be closed, expensive or too busy. Let’s make an application or website that allows people to post about cool local hikes, must sees, restaurants, etc. Then when you’re visiting an area you can see those places and go visit actually meaningful locations and live and feel like a local!
